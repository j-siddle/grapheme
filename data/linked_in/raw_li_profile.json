This involved extensive experimentation with NoSQL technologies such as Riak and MongoDB, though ultimately a custom in-memory solution was developed due to implementation constraints.\n\nOther activities include inception and development of a QA framework to assess the impact of changes in text mining rules across a vast corpus of documents.

This involved early design and prototyping, then extensive Java development using Test Driven Development in the HttpUnit framework, building on core domain model classes to expose secure and highly available REST resources for WBE artefacts. Thread safety was a key concern because of the asynchronous nature of Web 2.0 technologies; the resulting code ensured thread safety by serializing requests using a semaphore.\n\nIn addition to supporting direct programmatic access, this interface is the sole means through which a new application design UI communicates with project storage and deployment functionality in WBE 7.0. \n\nPreviously responsible for integration of WBE with other IBM products using HTTP and SOAP, along with the migration of WBE to use the JEE security model. Other activities include ScrumMastering, Agile coaching, test and documentation support, and more recently the delivery of a SupportPac providing an HTML and JavaScript helper for developers using the new REST interface.",
