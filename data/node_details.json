"Oxford University":"I attended Oxford as a mature student during the second half of the noughties. Oxford is a great University, both in terms of the educational programme and in terms of research outputs, culture, and history. It was a privilege to study Software Engineering there, my only regret is that I only scratched the surface of Oxford life!"
